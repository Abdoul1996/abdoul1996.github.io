        <h1>My Research</h1>
        
        <h2>Thesis: Predicting E. coli Drug Resistance Using Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h2>

        <p>
          My research centers on building computational pipelines and machine learning models that can predict antibiotic
          resistance in <em>E. coli</em>. For my thesis, I focus on a single antibiotic <strong>Ciprofloxacin(CIP)</strong> and use a 
          two complementary datasets: gene presence/absence and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The goal is to understand 
          how specific features influence resistance to CIP and develop predictive models that can identify resistant strains based on their genomics.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Antibiotic-resistant infections pose a serious global health threat. One of the main causes is drug
          resistant <em>(E. coli)</em>. Usually, testing if a bacterial strain is resistant takes a lot of time in the lab.
          But, now with faster genome sequencing and machine learning, we can try to predict resistance directly from DNA sequences.
          The challenge is that an <em>E.coli</em> genome has thousands of genes and mutations, and not all of them are important for resistance.
          Finding the right signals in all that data is hard task, and that's where machine learning can help.
        </p>

        <h2>My Solution &amp; Methods</h2>
        <p>
          I tackled this challenge by developing a machine learning pipeline that turns raw genomic data into actionable
          predictions of antibiotic resistance. My approach leverages complementary genomic feature sets and
          state-of-the-art ML techniques:
        </p>
        <ul class="solutions-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Data:</strong> I used whole-genome sequences from 588 <em>E. coli</em> strains, each labeled as <b>Resistant</b> or <b>Susceptible</b> to Ciprofloxacine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> I extracted two types of genomic features to capture different scales
            of variation:
            <ul class="solutions-sublist">
              <li>
                <em>Gene Presence/Absence Matrix:</em> This dataset contains 6,093 genes and shows whether each gene is present or absent in every strain.
                These genes mainly come from the shell genome, which includes genes shared by some, but not all strains. Constant features were removed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>SNP Variant Profiles:</em> This dataset includes 166,415 <b>single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</b> across all strains. SNPs were filtered using 
                minor allele frequency (MAF) and gap threshold to remove low-quality SNPs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Model Training:</strong> With these feature sets, I trained and tuned classification models to
            predict resistance. I experimented with various machine learning algorithms (e.g. logistic regression,random forests, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) and used rigorous cross-validation to avoid overfitting the high-dimensional data.
            Handling thousands of genomic features required careful feature selection and regularization to focus the
            models on the most informative signals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluation &amp; Comparison:</strong> I evaluated model performance separately using the
            gene-presence features and the SNP features to compare their predictive power. This analysis revealed which
            type of genetic signal is more indicative of resistance. I also explored combining both feature types in one
            model to capture both large-scale and fine-scale genetic factors, aiming for improved overall accuracy and
            robustness.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <p class="impact-note">
          <strong>Impact:</strong> This project showcases my ability to build real-world ML solutions for complex
          genomics data. I integrated domain knowledge (genome biology and feature extraction) with data science skills
          (model development and validation) to create a tool that could potentially predict antibiotic resistance faster
          than traditional lab tests. In doing so, I demonstrated how raw sequencing data can be transformed into
          actionable insights, effectively bridging the gap between cutting-edge biology and practical machine learning
          applications.

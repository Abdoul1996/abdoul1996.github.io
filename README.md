# Abdoulfatah Abdillahi – Portfolio

I am a Master's graduate student in Data Science and AI at San Francisco State University, with research experience in applying machine learning to predict E. coli drug resistance using pangenome datasets. Over the past two years, I worked with the [CodeLab](https://pleunipennings.wordpress.com/) team, where I focused on pangenome dataset creation, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation of ML models for predicting antibiotic resistance patterns. My work combines traditional machine learning with deep learning approaches to address critical challenges in computational biology and public health.

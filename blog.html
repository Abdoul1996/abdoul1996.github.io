        <h4>Introduction: Who Am I?</h4>
        <p>
          Hi there! 👋 I'm Abdoulfatah Abdillahi, a Master's student in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at San Francisco State University. For the past two years, I've been part of the CodeLab research team, where we use AI to tackle antibiotic resistance in E. coli.          </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" alt="Abdoulfatah Abdillahi in Arizona during SACNAS24 poster presentation" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Presenting my SACNAS 2024 poster in Phoenix, AZ</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          My work involves creating pangenome datasets and building machine learning models that can predict which antibiotics will work against different bacterial strains. It's fascinating stuff – we're essentially teaching computers to understand biology in ways that can help doctors and scientists make better decisions about patient care.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But here's what really caught my attention: while I was getting really good at the technical side of things, I started wondering about the people who would actually use these systems. How would a doctor interact with my models? Would a biologist without programming experience be able to understand my results? This curiosity led me straight to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and I'm so excited to share this journey with you!
        </p>

        <h4>Why Does HCI Excite Me?</h4>
        <p>
          This is my very first HCI course, and I have to admit – I didn't fully understand its importance during my undergraduate days, even though my friends kept talking about it. Now I get it, and I'm genuinely excited about what I'm learning.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/HCI.png" alt="Human-Computer Interaction diagram showing the relationship between humans, computers, and interaction design" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Human–Computer Interaction framework linking people, systems, and design</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          HCI isn't just about computers – it's about people. It's the art and science of making communication between humans and computer systems smooth, intuitive, and meaningful. Think about it: when you use an app on your phone, you don't want to struggle to figure out how it works. You want it to feel natural, almost like the app is reading your mind.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As someone who deals with complex biological problems every day, HCI excites me because it can help me explain my work more clearly, design better tools for scientists, and ensure my results are understandable even by people without a computer science background. The goal isn't just to build something that works – it's to build something that works beautifully for real people.
        </p>

        <h4>HCI in My Life: Three Positive Examples</h4>
        <p>
          Even before this course, I've been living with HCI every day—without realizing it. Here are three tools that shaped how I learn, work, and relax:
        </p>

        <h5>1. ChatGPT for Learning</h5>
        <p>
          One of my favorite examples is ChatGPT. It doesn't just answer questions—it feels like a knowledgeable friend.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/ChatGPT.png" alt="ChatGPT interface showing a helpful conversation about machine learning concepts" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">ChatGPT research workspace used for rapid ideation</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Have you ever used a tool that made learning feel effortless? That's what happens here. The interface is clean, the conversation flows naturally, and the ability to remember context lowers the "cognitive load" of learning.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This experience showed me that good HCI can turn something intimidating (like machine learning concepts) into something approachable.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Slack for Research Collaboration</h5>
        <p>
          In my research, Slack is our communication hub. What makes it special is how it organizes complexity without overwhelming us.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/slack.png" alt="Slack interface showing threaded conversations and file sharing in a research team context" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Slack research channels used to coordinate CodeLab collaboration</p>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Threaded conversations keep discussions tidy.</li>
          <li>Searchable history means I can find that one key message from weeks ago.</li>
          <li>Integrations with tools like Google Drive make collaboration seamless.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          The design reduces friction so my team can focus on research, not on navigating clunky software. That's HCI at its best: technology that "gets out of the way."
        </p>

        <h5>3. Spotify for Music Discovery</h5>
        <p>
          Finally, let's talk about Spotify. I love discovering new music, and its recommendation system feels almost magical.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The "Discover Weekly" playlist is like having a friend who knows my taste better than I do. I don't have to think about algorithms—it just works. The clean design and cross-device integration make the whole experience feel smooth and personal.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To me, this is a perfect HCI example: advanced tech made invisible through thoughtful design.
        </p>

        <h4>How HCI Shapes My Growth</h4>
        <p>
          For a long time, I used these tools without realizing they were products of HCI research and design. Now I understand that learning HCI changes the way I see technology. Instead of only asking "What does this system do?" I now ask, "How will people experience this system?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This shift is crucial for my career goals. I want to become someone who creates solutions that are not just technically advanced, but also human-friendly. For example, in my research, I hope to design interfaces that present complex biological data in simple, visual ways so biologists – even those without programming knowledge – can understand and use the results.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          HCI is helping me grow empathy, clarity, and communication skills. These are qualities that I believe will help me become the best version of my dream self – a researcher who bridges the gap between advanced AI and real-world users.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blog-quote">
          <p>HCI is my reminder that even the most complex AI ideas must feel simple, respectful, and human to be meaningful.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>My Semester Project: PathFinder</h4>
        <p>
          Speaking of bridging gaps, let me tell you about my semester project: <strong>PathFinder</strong>. It's a web application designed to assist Computer Science students at SFSU with smart course planning, complete with chatbot support for enhanced interactivity and personalization.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/pathFinder.png" alt="PathFinder web application interface showing course planning features for SFSU students" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">PathFinder landing page - Smart course planning interface for SFSU Computer Science students</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          This project is deeply personal to me. As a first-generation college student, I struggled significantly with course selection during my undergraduate studies. I often relied on unclear or biased advice from friends and seniors, and I frequently wished for a straightforward, simple, and reliable system to guide me through the maze of course requirements and prerequisites.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          PathFinder is my solution to this problem for future generations of students. My goal is to build a functional system by the end of the semester that students can actively use, helping them feel more confident and less overwhelmed when planning their academic journey.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The HCI principles I'm learning will be crucial in making PathFinder truly useful. I need to understand how students think about course planning, what information they need most, and how to present complex academic requirements in a way that feels supportive rather than overwhelming.
        </p>

        <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
        <p>
          This is just the beginning of my HCI journey, and I'm excited to see how these principles will shape not just my semester project, but my entire approach to creating technology that serves people. Every day, I'm learning to see the world through the lens of human experience, and I can't wait to share more insights as this journey continues.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Stay tuned for the next blog in this series, where I'll dive deeper into specific HCI principles and how they're influencing my work on PathFinder!

        <h4>From Startup Dreams to User Research Reality</h4>
        <p>
          Before I took the class, I had been thinking of starting my own startup company. I even reached out to my Principal Investigator (PI) to get an idea if we could switch our research to a startup company. Because we are solving a real problem, unfortunately, my PI moved to Europe for personal reasons, as you can see in our chat:
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/PI.png" alt="Chat conversation showing PI's response about moving to Europe" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">My conversation with my PI about potential startup collaboration</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Still, I wasn't discouraged. I knew I would pursue the idea when the right opportunity came. When the semester began, I felt energized during the first week of HCI. To me, HCI felt like a mini Y Combinator: a chance to ignite my idea, collaborate with a small team, and engage with stakeholders such as Dr. Sanika Doolani. That's when I proposed my project, PathFinder, which I introduced in my first blog.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In this second blog, I'll take a deeper dive into my User Research journey. As a completed undergraduate at SFSU, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of planning courses, dealing with prerequisites, limited class availability, and navigating advisor access. But I knew my own story couldn't be the only perspective, and I didn't want my personal frustrations to bias the app design. To test my idea, I turned to other students.
        </p>

        <h4>My Research Approach</h4>
        <p>
          I focused on diversity in my participants, including undergraduates, transfer students, and graduate students to better understand how they plan their courses and what obstacles they face. My goal was to identify unmet needs and opportunities for innovation that could guide the design of PathFinder, ensuring it is student-centered, reduces stress, and helps students stay on track for timely graduation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To achieve this, I used multiple UX research methods, starting with a survey. The survey allowed me to collect quantitative insights and validate patterns across a broader group of students. Here's what I discovered:
        </p>

        <h4>Participant Demographics</h4>
        <p>
          I collected responses from 18 students across different stages of study. The majority were seniors (67%), with smaller groups of juniors, graduates, sophomores, and freshmen. This gave me perspectives from students close to graduation as well as those earlier in their academic journey.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/YearStudy.png" alt="Pie chart showing distribution of students by year of study - 67% Seniors, 11.1% each for Graduate and Junior, with smaller portions for Sophomore and Freshman" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Distribution of survey participants by academic year</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Advising Access Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          When asked about advising frequency, two-thirds of students (67%) reported meeting their advisor only once per semester, while another 28% met just a few times per semester. This shows that many students lack regular advising, leaving room for confusion about prerequisites and graduation planning.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/career_advice.png" alt="Pie chart showing advising frequency - 66.7% once a semester, 27.8% a few times a semester, 5.5% weekly" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Frequency of meetings with academic or career advisers</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Strong Interest in Technology-Driven Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          Students showed strong enthusiasm for technology-driven advising support. Over 88% of respondents said they were interested or very interested in an app that would provide CS-specific advising without requiring appointments.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/interestAI.png" alt="Pie chart showing app interest - 55.6% interested, 33.3% very interested, 11.1% neutral" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Student interest in an app for CS-focused advising without appointments</p>
        </div>

        <h4>AI-Powered Chatbot Potential</h4>
        <p>
          Similarly, students viewed a chatbot trained on advising information as a helpful resource. More than 70% found it helpful or very helpful, while only a small fraction were neutral or doubtful. This suggests that AI-driven advising tools could complement human advisors and improve accessibility.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/chatbot_helpful.png" alt="Pie chart showing chatbot helpfulness - 50% somewhat helpful, 22.2% very helpful, 16.7% neutral, 11.1% not very helpful" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Perceived helpfulness of a chatbot trained on CS advising information</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Key Insights That Shaped PathFinder</h4>
        <p>
          These findings were eye-opening and directly influenced how I approached PathFinder's design:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accessibility Gap:</strong> The limited advisor access confirmed that students need alternative ways to get guidance, especially for quick questions about prerequisites and course planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology Readiness:</strong> The overwhelming interest in tech solutions showed that students are ready to embrace digital tools for academic planning.</li>
          <li><strong>AI Acceptance:</strong> The positive reception to chatbot technology validated my decision to include AI-powered features in PathFinder.</li>
          <li><strong>Diverse Needs:</strong> Having participants from different academic levels helped me understand that the app needs to serve both new students and those nearing graduation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Beyond the Data: Personal Reflections</h4>
        <p>
          Conducting this research taught me that user research isn't just about collecting data—it's about understanding people's real struggles and designing solutions that truly help. The process of talking to students, analyzing their responses, and seeing the patterns emerge made me realize how much I had been making assumptions about what students needed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This experience reinforced my belief that good design comes from understanding users deeply, not from building what we think they want. It also showed me the power of combining quantitative data (surveys) with qualitative insights to create a complete picture of user needs.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blog-quote">
          <p>The more I listened, the clearer it became that PathFinder must speak the language of overwhelmed students, not just designers.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
        <p>
          Armed with these insights, I'm now more confident than ever that PathFinder addresses a real need. The research validated my initial instincts while also revealing new opportunities I hadn't considered. Most importantly, it reminded me that the best solutions come from listening to the people who will actually use them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In my next blog, I'll share how these research findings are shaping the actual design and development of PathFinder, and how I'm applying HCI principles to create an interface that students will love to use.

        <h4>From Idea to Solution: Defining Your Concept</h4>
        <p>
          After weeks of user research and interviews with SFSU Computer Science students, our team finally had enough insights to move from problem identification to solution design. The challenge was clear: students needed better course planning tools, but the question remained – how do we transform this understanding into a tangible solution that could be communicated effectively?
        </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>
          We began with what felt like chaos – sticky notes everywhere, each representing a different insight from our interviews. The process was messy but necessary. We clustered related problems, identified patterns, and gradually began to see the shape of our solution emerging from the research data.
        </p>

          <p class="blog-image-caption">POV and HMW Notes</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          The breakthrough came when we started asking "How might we..." questions. Instead of getting stuck on problems, we began exploring possibilities. How might we help students visualize their academic journey? How might we make course prerequisites less intimidating? How might we provide personalized guidance without overwhelming students with too many options?
        </p>

        <h4>Behind the Scenes: Shooting/Creating the Concept Video</h4>
        <p>
          Creating a concept video felt daunting at first. We had the ideas, but translating them into a compelling visual story required a different kind of thinking. Our brainstorming sessions were intense – we went through dozens of iterations before landing on a narrative that felt authentic to the student experience.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blog-image figure-callout">
          <img src="assets/images/brainStorming.png" alt="Brainstorming screenshots showing collaborative ideation process for the concept video" loading="lazy" />
          <p class="blog-image-caption">Brainstorming Sessions</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          The storyboard became our roadmap. We sketched out each scene, thinking carefully about what the user would see, feel, and experience. Every frame needed to serve a purpose – either introducing the problem, demonstrating the solution, or showing the positive impact on the student's journey.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The actual filming and editing process taught us about the importance of iteration in design. What looked good on paper didn't always translate to the screen. We learned to be flexible, to adapt our vision based on what worked best for communicating our core message. Each revision brought us closer to a video that truly captured the essence of PathFinder.

        </div>

        <h4>The User Perspective: Who Benefits from Our Solution</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout our design process, we revisited the insights from our interviews with students like <strong>Juve</strong>, a graduate student balancing research and coursework, and <strong>Sita</strong>, an undergraduate still finding her path in Computer Science. Their experiences shaped how we defined PathFinder’s goals and features.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we shared early versions of the concept video with them, their feedback validated our direction. Juve appreciated how PathFinder visualized degree progress, while Sita said it reduced her stress around course selection. Their responses confirmed that PathFinder was solving a real and relatable problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          This reminded me that good design goes beyond functionality—it’s about empathy. By keeping Juve and Sita’s stories at the center, the concept video became more than a prototype; it became a reflection of real student needs.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blog-quote">
          <p>Every storyboard frame now starts with a person’s anxiety or hope—not a feature list.</p>
        </blockquote>



        <h4>Reflection: What I Learned About Design Thinking and Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          Creating the PathFinder concept video pushed me beyond technical problem-solving and into the human story behind each decision. I saw first-hand that strong design comes from collaboration, continuous feedback, and the humility to change course when something isn't working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual storytelling turned abstract ideas into something people could feel and understand. The video helped stakeholders grasp not only <em>what</em> we're building, but <em>why</em> it matters to students.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began as scattered interview notes became a coherent solution through rapid iteration and teamwork. Moving forward, every PathFinder choice will be filtered through the needs of our users. To me, HCI is simple: build technology that truly serves people—one thoughtful choice at a time.

        <h4>Bringing Ideas to Life: My Rapid Prototyping</h4>
        <p>
          In our last blog, I shared the concept solution and concept video for our product. This new phase, <strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong>, was about turning our ideas into something real and testable. A prototype, even a rough one, allows us to explore the user experience (UX), identify pain points, and refine our design thinking. For me, this stage was both exciting and challenging because it brought our concept closer to an actual product.
        </p>

        <h4>1. The First Attempt: Bringing the Idea to Life</h4>
        <p>
          At the beginning, my team and I didn't know exactly where to start. We decided to use an iPhone template shared by our professor as the foundation for our design. Before sketching, we discussed which features were most important for our users. Since our concept video already highlighted the main functions, we listed those features on paper, like the AI course advisor, Smart Planner, and Transfer, and began sketching our first paper prototype.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Our first prototype was honestly a bit messy. The sketches were rough, and some screens didn't fully connect in flow. However, even without full functionality, this stage was eye-opening. We could see how the basic layout would look and whether the user's journey made sense. The paper prototype helped us visualize transitions, spot friction points, and discuss usability before spending time on digital tools.
        </p>

          <p class="blog-image-caption">Figure 1: Paper Prototype - Our initial sketches exploring PathFinder's core features</p>
        </div>

        <h4>2. Testing & Learning: Gathering Early Feedback</h4>
        <p>
          We wanted to understand how real users would interact with our design, so we conducted usability testing with two students from SFSU, a freshman, and junior transfer student. Each participant tested our Pathfinder prototype by completing two main tasks:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Smart Planner to find and compare courses.</li>
          <li>Ask the AI chatbot for course prerequisite advice.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Our early digital prototype had basic navigation and limited interactivity. Some features, such as filters and chatbot responses, were incomplete. Course details and confirmation messages were handwritten placeholders, and mobile input boxes were too small. Users also noticed that there wasn't clear visual feedback after saving or comparing courses.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Despite these rough edges, the tests were incredibly valuable. Users appreciated the concept and said the design felt practical for students planning their degrees. However, they struggled with unclear navigation and inconsistent spacing between elements. My roommate, who also tested the prototype, said it was "a great idea but confusing at first glance" because there weren't clear tabs to guide users between sections.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Hearing this feedback was humbling but helpful—it reminded me that what seems obvious to a designer isn't always obvious to a user.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Iteration & Improvement: Refining the Prototype</h4>
        <p>
          After reviewing the feedback, I led our team in updating the prototype in Figma. Since I had prior experience with Figma, I took the initiative to create a low-fidelity digital wireframe that was easy to navigate even without instructions. We made several key improvements:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear Navigation:</strong> Added structured tabs (Home, Planner, Transfer, Research, Settings) to make movement between sections smoother.</li>
          <li><strong>Dashboard Overview:</strong> Introduced progress bars and degree summaries to make completion tracking more intuitive.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Planner:</strong> Included AI assistant suggestions, prerequisite alerts, and a "Save Plan" confirmation message.</li>
          <li><strong>Transfer Credits:</strong> Added search filters and clearer articulation layouts for transfer students.</li>
          <li><strong>Research & Career Alignment:</strong> Integrated AI match percentages and elective descriptions for better context.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Adjusted input fields and text areas for better mobile usability.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <p>
          This iteration phase was where the prototype really came to life. Seeing our static paper sketches evolve into a clickable, interactive design was rewarding. Each new version felt closer to a real product.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Personal Reflection: The Rapid Prototyping Experience</h4>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of rapid prototyping was balancing design clarity and simplicity. I wanted the prototype to feel intuitive, but sometimes I overcomplicated features or layouts. It took several revisions to realize that good design often means doing less, not more. Another challenge was aligning everyone's ideas in the team—each of us imagined the user flow differently at first.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          What I enjoyed most was seeing how quickly ideas could evolve through feedback. Every test, even small ones, helped us make better decisions. I also gained confidence using Figma and learned how to translate user comments into concrete design improvements.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If I could give advice to someone doing rapid prototyping for the first time, I'd say: don't aim for perfection. The goal isn't to create a flawless product, it's to learn fast, fail early, and improve continuously. Your first draft will always feel imperfect, but that's part of the process. The real magic happens when you let users show you what works and what doesn't.
        </p>

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          Rapid prototyping helped me understand that UX design is less about tools and more about empathy. The process taught me how to listen to users, adapt quickly, and collaborate creatively. Most importantly, it made me realize that even a simple sketch can spark big improvements when guided by real feedback.

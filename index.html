       <h2>About</h2>
       <p>
         Hi, I am <strong>Abdoulfatah Abdillahi</strong> (just call me <strong>Abdoul</strong>). I'm originally from East Africa, in <strong>Djibouti</strong>. I am a passionate Computer Science student who enjoys learning new things about technology and research methodologies.
       </p>
       <p>
         I earned my BSc in Computer Science in December 2023 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at <strong>San Francisco State University</strong>. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science and AI, deepening my interdisciplinary skills and making impactful contributions at the intersection of computer science and biology.
       </p>
       <p>
         My graduate thesis focuses on predicting <em>E. coli</em> drug resistance using traditional machine learning and deep learning models, under the guidance of Professor <strong>Dr. Pleuni Pennings</strong> (Biologist) and <strong>Dr. Sara El Alaouni</strong> (Computer Scientist).
       </p>
       <p>
         I also completed an industry internship at <strong>Genentech</strong> in San Francisco, CA, where I worked as a bioinformatics researcher contributing to real-world biomedical data analysis.
       </p>
       <p>When I am not studying or researching, I enjoy going for runs, playing soccer, and chilling with close ones. I also like to visit historical places such as Egypt, Ethiopia</p>

          Hi, I am <span class="highlight">Abdoulfatah Abdillahi</span> (just call me <span class="highlight">Abdoul</span>). I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science and AI at San Francisco State University, where my thesis focuses on predicting <em>E. coli</em> drug resistance using machine learning and deep learning models under the guidance of Dr. Pleuni Pennings and Dr. Sara El Alaouni.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring hands-on ML engineering experience from my industry internship at <span class="highlight">Genentech</span> and 2+ years of graduate research at the intersection of computer science and biology. My expertise spans bioinformatics, deep learning (CNNs, VAEs), and high-performance computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academics, I enjoy running, playing soccer, and visiting historical places like Egypt and Ethiopia.

          <h4>Introduction: Who Am I?</h4>
          <p>
            Hi there! 👋 I’m Abdoulfatah Abdillahi, a Master’s student in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at San Francisco State University. For the past two years, I’ve been part of the CodeLab research team, where we use AI to tackle antibiotic resistance in E. coli.          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" alt="Abdoulfatah Abdillahi in Arizona during SACNAS24 poster presentation" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">Abdoul in Arizona during SACNAS24 poster presentation</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            My work involves creating pangenome datasets and building machine learning models that can predict which antibiotics will work against different bacterial strains. It's fascinating stuff – we're essentially teaching computers to understand biology in ways that can help doctors and scientists make better decisions about patient care.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But here's what really caught my attention: while I was getting really good at the technical side of things, I started wondering about the people who would actually use these systems. How would a doctor interact with my models? Would a biologist without programming experience be able to understand my results? This curiosity led me straight to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and I'm so excited to share this journey with you!
          </p>

          <h4>Why Does HCI Excite Me?</h4>
          <p>
            This is my very first HCI course, and I have to admit – I didn't fully understand its importance during my undergraduate days, even though my friends kept talking about it. Now I get it, and I'm genuinely excited about what I'm learning.
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/HCI.png" alt="Human-Computer Interaction diagram showing the relationship between humans, computers, and interaction design" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">Understanding the relationship between humans, computers, and interaction design</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            HCI isn't just about computers – it's about people. It's the art and science of making communication between humans and computer systems smooth, intuitive, and meaningful. Think about it: when you use an app on your phone, you don't want to struggle to figure out how it works. You want it to feel natural, almost like the app is reading your mind.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As someone who deals with complex biological problems every day, HCI excites me because it can help me explain my work more clearly, design better tools for scientists, and ensure my results are understandable even by people without a computer science background. The goal isn't just to build something that works – it's to build something that works beautifully for real people.
          </p>

          <h4>HCI in My Life: Three Positive Examples</h4>
          <p>
            Even before this course, I've been living with HCI every day—without realizing it. Here are three tools that shaped how I learn, work, and relax:

            One of my favorite examples is ChatGPT. It doesn't just answer questions—it feels like a knowledgeable friend.
          </p>

            <p class="blog-image-caption">Abdoul ChatGPT home page</p>
          
          <p>
            Have you ever used a tool that made learning feel effortless? That's what happens here. The interface is clean, the conversation flows naturally, and the ability to remember context lowers the "cognitive load" of learning.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This experience showed me that good HCI can turn something intimidating (like machine learning concepts) into something approachable.
          </p>

          <h5>2. Slack for Research Collaboration</h5>
          <p>
            In my research, Slack is our communication hub. What makes it special is how it organizes complexity without overwhelming us.
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/slack.png" alt="Slack interface showing threaded conversations and file sharing in a research team context" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">Abdoul Slack home page Interactive with my team to collaborate on research</p>
          </div>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Threaded conversations keep discussions tidy.</li>
            <li>Searchable history means I can find that one key message from weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Integrations with tools like Google Drive make collaboration seamless.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The design reduces friction so my team can focus on research, not on navigating clunky software. That's HCI at its best: technology that "gets out of the way."
          </p>

          <h5>3. Spotify for Music Discovery</h5>
          <p>
            Finally, let's talk about Spotify. I love discovering new music, and its recommendation system feels almost magical.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The "Discover Weekly" playlist is like having a friend who knows my taste better than I do. I don't have to think about algorithms—it just works. The clean design and cross-device integration make the whole experience feel smooth and personal.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To me, this is a perfect HCI example: advanced tech made invisible through thoughtful design.
          </p>

          <h4>How HCI Shapes My Growth</h4>
          <p>
            For a long time, I used these tools without realizing they were products of HCI research and design. Now I understand that learning HCI changes the way I see technology. Instead of only asking "What does this system do?" I now ask, "How will people experience this system?"
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This shift is crucial for my career goals. I want to become someone who creates solutions that are not just technically advanced, but also human-friendly. For example, in my research, I hope to design interfaces that present complex biological data in simple, visual ways so biologists – even those without programming knowledge – can understand and use the results.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            HCI is helping me grow empathy, clarity, and communication skills. These are qualities that I believe will help me become the best version of my dream self – a researcher who bridges the gap between advanced AI and real-world users.
          </p>

          <h4>My Semester Project: PathFinder</h4>
          <p>
            Speaking of bridging gaps, let me tell you about my semester project: <strong>PathFinder</strong>. It's a web application designed to assist Computer Science students at SFSU with smart course planning, complete with chatbot support for enhanced interactivity and personalization.
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/pathFinder.png" alt="PathFinder web application interface showing course planning features for SFSU students" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">PathFinder landing page - Smart course planning interface for SFSU Computer Science students</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            This project is deeply personal to me. As a first-generation college student, I struggled significantly with course selection during my undergraduate studies. I often relied on unclear or biased advice from friends and seniors, and I frequently wished for a straightforward, simple, and reliable system to guide me through the maze of course requirements and prerequisites.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            PathFinder is my solution to this problem for future generations of students. My goal is to build a functional system by the end of the semester that students can actively use, helping them feel more confident and less overwhelmed when planning their academic journey.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The HCI principles I'm learning will be crucial in making PathFinder truly useful. I need to understand how students think about course planning, what information they need most, and how to present complex academic requirements in a way that feels supportive rather than overwhelming.
          </p>

          <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
          <p>
            This is just the beginning of my HCI journey, and I'm excited to see how these principles will shape not just my semester project, but my entire approach to creating technology that serves people. Every day, I'm learning to see the world through the lens of human experience, and I can't wait to share more insights as this journey continues.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Stay tuned for the next blog in this series, where I'll dive deeper into specific HCI principles and how they're influencing my work on PathFinder!

          <h4>From Startup Dreams to User Research Reality</h4>
          <p>
            Before I took the class, I had been thinking of starting my own startup company. I even reached out to my Principal Investigator (PI) to get an idea if we could switch our research to a startup company. Because we are solving a real problem, unfortunately, my PI moved to Europe for personal reasons, as you can see in our chat:
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/PI.png" alt="Chat conversation showing PI's response about moving to Europe" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">My conversation with my PI about potential startup collaboration</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Still, I wasn't discouraged. I knew I would pursue the idea when the right opportunity came. When the semester began, I felt energized during the first week of HCI. To me, HCI felt like a mini Y Combinator: a chance to ignite my idea, collaborate with a small team, and engage with stakeholders such as Dr. Sanika Doolani. That's when I proposed my project, PathFinder, which I introduced in my first blog.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In this second blog, I'll take a deeper dive into my User Research journey. As a completed undergraduate at SFSU, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of planning courses, dealing with prerequisites, limited class availability, and navigating advisor access. But I knew my own story couldn't be the only perspective, and I didn't want my personal frustrations to bias the app design. To test my idea, I turned to other students.
          </p>

          <h4>My Research Approach</h4>
          <p>
            I focused on diversity in my participants, including undergraduates, transfer students, and graduate students to better understand how they plan their courses and what obstacles they face. My goal was to identify unmet needs and opportunities for innovation that could guide the design of PathFinder, ensuring it is student-centered, reduces stress, and helps students stay on track for timely graduation.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To achieve this, I used multiple UX research methods, starting with a survey. The survey allowed me to collect quantitative insights and validate patterns across a broader group of students. Here's what I discovered:
          </p>

          <h4>Participant Demographics</h4>
          <p>
            I collected responses from 18 students across different stages of study. The majority were seniors (67%), with smaller groups of juniors, graduates, sophomores, and freshmen. This gave me perspectives from students close to graduation as well as those earlier in their academic journey.
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/YearStudy.png" alt="Pie chart showing distribution of students by year of study - 67% Seniors, 11.1% each for Graduate and Junior, with smaller portions for Sophomore and Freshman" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">Distribution of survey participants by academic year</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Advising Access Challenges</h4>
          <p>
            When asked about advising frequency, two-thirds of students (67%) reported meeting their advisor only once per semester, while another 28% met just a few times per semester. This shows that many students lack regular advising, leaving room for confusion about prerequisites and graduation planning.
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/career_advice.png" alt="Pie chart showing advising frequency - 66.7% once a semester, 27.8% a few times a semester, 5.5% weekly" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">Frequency of meetings with academic or career advisers</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Strong Interest in Technology-Driven Solutions</h4>
          <p>
            Students showed strong enthusiasm for technology-driven advising support. Over 88% of respondents said they were interested or very interested in an app that would provide CS-specific advising without requiring appointments.
          </p>
          
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="assets/images/interestAI.png" alt="Pie chart showing app interest - 55.6% interested, 33.3% very interested, 11.1% neutral" loading="lazy" />
            <p class="blog-image-caption">Student interest in an app for CS-focused advising without appointments</p>
          </div>

          <h4>AI-Powered Chatbot Potential</h4>
          <p>
            Similarly, students viewed a chatbot trained on advising information as a helpful resource. More than 70% found it helpful or very helpful, while only a small fraction were neutral or doubtful. This suggests that AI-driven advising tools could complement human advisors and improve accessibility.

            <p class="blog-image-caption">Perceived helpfulness of a chatbot trained on CS advising information</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Key Insights That Shaped PathFinder</h4>
          <p>
            These findings were eye-opening and directly influenced how I approached PathFinder's design:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility Gap:</strong> The limited advisor access confirmed that students need alternative ways to get guidance, especially for quick questions about prerequisites and course planning.</li>
            <li><strong>Technology Readiness:</strong> The overwhelming interest in tech solutions showed that students are ready to embrace digital tools for academic planning.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Acceptance:</strong> The positive reception to chatbot technology validated my decision to include AI-powered features in PathFinder.</li>
            <li><strong>Diverse Needs:</strong> Having participants from different academic levels helped me understand that the app needs to serve both new students and those nearing graduation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Beyond the Data: Personal Reflections</h4>
          <p>
            Conducting this research taught me that user research isn't just about collecting data—it's about understanding people's real struggles and designing solutions that truly help. The process of talking to students, analyzing their responses, and seeing the patterns emerge made me realize how much I had been making assumptions about what students needed.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This experience reinforced my belief that good design comes from understanding users deeply, not from building what we think they want. It also showed me the power of combining quantitative data (surveys) with qualitative insights to create a complete picture of user needs.
          </p>

          <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
          <p>
            Armed with these insights, I'm now more confident than ever that PathFinder addresses a real need. The research validated my initial instincts while also revealing new opportunities I hadn't considered. Most importantly, it reminded me that the best solutions come from listening to the people who will actually use them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In my next blog, I'll share how these research findings are shaping the actual design and development of PathFinder, and how I'm applying HCI principles to create an interface that students will love to use.

          Hi, I am <span class="highlight">Abdoulfatah Abdillahi</span> (just call me <span class="highlight">Abdoul</span>). I'm originally from East Africa, in <span class="highlight">Djibouti</span>. I am a passionate Computer Science student who enjoys learning new things about technology and research methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I earned my BSc in Computer Science in December 2023 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at <span class="highlight">San Francisco State University</span>. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science and AI, deepening my interdisciplinary skills and making impactful contributions at the intersection of computer science and biology.
        </p>
        <p>
          My graduate thesis focuses on predicting <em>E. coli</em> drug resistance using traditional machine learning and deep learning models, under the guidance of Professor <span class="highlight">Dr. Pleuni Pennings</span> (Biologist) and <span class="highlight">Dr. Sara El Alaouni</span> (Computer Scientist).
        </p>
        <p>
          I also completed an industry internship at <span class="highlight">Genentech</span> in San Francisco, CA, where I worked as a bioinformatics researcher contributing to real-world biomedical data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not studying or researching, I enjoy going for runs, playing soccer, and chilling with close ones. I also like to visit historical places such as Egypt, Ethiopia.
